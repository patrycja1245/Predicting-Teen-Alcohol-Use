# Predictive Modeling of Alcohol Consumption Among High School Students

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a predictive model to analyze and forecast alcohol consumption patterns among high school students. The model aims to provide insights into factors influencing drinking behavior and predict future trends based on historical data.

## Objectives

- **Develop a Predictive Model**: Create a model to predict alcohol consumption patterns among high school students.
- **Analyze Influencing Factors**: Identify key factors that affect alcohol consumption and their impact.
- **Forecast Trends**: Provide predictions on future alcohol consumption trends based on historical data.

## Data

The model utilizes data collected from high school students, including:
- Demographic information (age, gender, etc.)
- Behavioral patterns (drinking frequency, peer influence, etc.)
- Academic performance
- Social factors

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Gather and preprocess data relevant to alcohol consumption.
2. **Feature Selection**: Identify and select key features that influence drinking behavior.
3. **Model Development**: Implement and train predictive models using machine learning algorithms.
4. **Evaluation**: Assess the modelâ€™s performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
5. **Forecasting**: Use the model to predict future alcohol consumption trends.
